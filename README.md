# SongChecker
Checks for bad Clone Hero song folders. Outputs a list of folders without an .ogg or .mp3 file located within. Makes for easier broken song cleaning.

Run the .exe file and type in (better yet, copy/paste) your Songs folder. 
The Program will create a text file with all of the folders with no .ogg or .mp3 files.
Double check these folders! Some of these will have sub-folders with the songs in them!
